# Adding a team member to the website

1. Filenames have the structure `YYYY-Firstname-Lastname`. The year is the year you started in the lab. Example: `2021-Alexandra-Ion.md`. Make sure that the filename is *unique*.

2. Add a photo of yourself as in the folder `/assets/people/`. The aspect ratio is **square** and with min. 400 px. Use the filename above, i.e., `YYYY-Firstname-Lastname.[jpg|png]`. 
For busy backgrounds, run your photo through the a background remover tool (e.g., https://www.remove.bg/) and use a neutral background image, or `#dadada` as the background color.

3. Create a new `*.md` in `/_people/`. Use the filename above, i.e., `YYYY-Firstname-Lastname.md`

Then fill it with the following content.
