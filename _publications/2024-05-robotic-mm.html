<p>
  We propose augmenting initially passive structures built from simple repeated cells, 
  with novel active units to enable dynamic, shape-changing, and robotic applications. 
  Inspired by metamaterials that can employ mechanisms, 
  we build a framework that allows users to configure cells of this passive structure 
  to allow it to perform complex tasks. 
  A key benefit is that our structures can be repeatedly (re)configured by users inserting 
  our configuration units to turn the passive material into, e.g., locomotion robots, 
  integrated motion platforms, or interactive interfaces, as we demonstrate in this paper.

<p>
To this end, we present a mechanical system consisting of a flexible, passive, shearing lattice structure, 
as well as rigid and active unit cells to be inserted into the lattice for configuration. 
The active unit is a closed-loop pneumatically controlled shearing cell to dynamically actuate 
the macroscopic movement of the structure. The passive rigid cells redirect the forces to create 
complex motion with a reduced number of active cells. Since the placement of the rigid and active 
units is challenging, we offer a computational design tool. The tool optimizes the cell placement 
to match the macroscopic, user-defined target motions and generates the control code for the active cells.
